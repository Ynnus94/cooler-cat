### 🔍 HOW TO USE THE GLOSSARY:
1. When reviewing a translation, identify ALL terms that might be in the glossary.
2. For EACH term found in the English source, check if it exists in the Notion Glossary.
3. If the term exists in the glossary, the French translation MUST match the fr_FR entry exactly.
4. If there's a mismatch, flag it as TC-0.5 and provide the correct term from the glossary.
5. Remember: The glossary contains ALL validated terms - check ALL items, not just some.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **CHECK ALL ITEMS**: You must check EVERY SINGLE term in the translation against ALL items in the Notion Glossary.
- The glossary is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for terminology.
- If a term is in the glossary, it MUST be used exactly as specified.
- Do NOT accept alternative translations for glossary terms.
- The glossary contains hundreds of validated terms - you must check ALL of them, not just a few.
- When reviewing a translation, systematically go through the source text and identify every term that might be in the glossary.
- For each identified term, verify it matches the fr_FR entry exactly.
- If you find ANY mismatch with the glossary, it's a TC-0.5 error.
